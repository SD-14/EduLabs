# Lab Overview
[Azure Machine Learning Designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-designer) gives you a cloud-based interactive, visual workspace that you can use to easily and quickly prep data, train and deploy machine learning models. It supports Azure Machine Learning compute, GPU or CPU.

In this lab, we will be using **Adult Census Income Dataset** which is available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income). The data is enriched with census data which contains many details like 'Age, Education, Marital Status, Occupation, Income'. We will learn to use Azure Machine Learning to process data, build, train, score, and evaluate a regression model to predict Income. To train the model, we will create Azure Machine Learning Compute resource. 

# Exercise 1: Register Dataset with Azure Machine Learning Studio

## Task 5: Train Model

We are going to be using a **Classification** algorithm , and we will be making use of **Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree** which is ideal in predicting true or false scenario.Hence, we want to train our model, and we begin to split the data before training our model.

1. In the left navigation pane, remove the entires from Search bar and then, click on **Machine Learning Algorithms** from the list and scroll down until you find **Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree**.

   ![Connection Evaluate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SD-14/EduLabs/main/MachineLearning/Images/028.png)
   
4. The 20% of the left-over data in **Split Data** function will be used in **Score Model** function, the score model function contains the trained algorithm function will come across 20% data which is untrained or unexpected, and this will help us determine whether the **Score Model** function is capable of accuartely predicting a person's income or not.( **Training Any ML Model:** 70-80% of data is taken as training data and the remaining 20-30% data is used as test data to check the accuracy of the model).
